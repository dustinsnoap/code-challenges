What is an algorithm?
-A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

How do you improve?
-Devise a plan for solving problems.
-Master common problem solving patterns.

=Devising a plan=
Understand the Problem.
-Restate problem in your own words.
-What are the inputs and outputs for the problem?
-What do the inputs and outputs look like?
-Is there enough information to solve the problem.
-How should important pieces of data be labeled?

Explore concrete examples.
-Why?
--Helps you understand the problem better.
--Provides sanity checks that your eventual solution works as it should.
-User Stories
--Given a user actions what should happen?
-Steps
--Write down 2 or 3 simple examples. (easiest use cases)
--Progress to more complex examples.
--Explore examples with empty inputs.
--Explore examples with invalid inputs.

Break it down.
-Why?
--Forces you to think about the code you'll write before you write it.
--Helps catch lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings.
-How?
--Write out steps that need to be followed to solve the problem.
---First generally, then detailed.

Solve/Simplify.
-Solve the problem if you can; else solve a simpler problem.
--Helps gain insight into the harder part of the problem.
--Gives you something to show for yourself in an interview.
-Steps
--Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do.
--Temporarily ignore that difficulty.
--Write a simplified solution.
--Incorporate that difficulty back in.

Look back and refactor.
-Questions to ask:
--Can you check the result?
--Can you derive the result differently?
---Is there another way to solve the problem?
--Can you understand it at a glance?
---How readable is the solution?
--Can you use the result or method for another problem?
---Are there any similaraties to different problems you solved in the past?
--Can you improve the performance of the solution?
---How can you make it perform better?
--Can you think of any other ways to refactor?
---Does it follor company guidelines?
---Is the spacing consistent?
--How have other people solved this problem?
---Ask an interviewer how other people solved it.
